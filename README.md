# Implied Volatility Surface for SPY Options

A Python application that visualizes the implied volatility surface for SPY options. Using real-time SPY option data from Yahoo Finance, the app calculates implied volatility based on the Black-Scholes model and plots a 3D surface to show how implied volatility varies with time to expiration and strike price. The user-friendly Streamlit interface allows for easy adjustments to model parameters.
